        <h2>I play a lot of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, and these games involve a lot of dice rolling to determine whether or not something your character does is a success, a failure, or a critical hit/miss.  Since there's no single system of what dice to roll or what the numbers mean, it can be hard to find a good dice rolling program for your particular ruleset.  I also got tired of rolling my dice off of tables/desks/other flat surfaces and having to keep manual track of all the results. That's why I made a program that lets the user define their own rules/sets of dice, and tells you how many successes, failures and criticals that you get for you.</h2>

        <h2>I like killing time with incremental games and was interested in trying out Android app development, so I made an app that you can find on the Android Play Store.  In this text-based game, players take the role of a leader founding a new settlement, which they will guide through every stage of growth from a humble beginning to great prosperity.  Players' choices will influence how they reach the status of an empire as well as help to craft a narrative that will surround their journey.</h2>

        <h2>I once came across an idea to create a Python script that would parse through a list of documents, count the most frequently occurring words, and output the top five words with their accompanying sentences and the documents in which they appear.  It was interesting because I had to account for a number of special cases that occur in text files.  As one Stack Overflow contributer put it, "Not all sentences end with a period."  To account for these cases, I used the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk">NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).</a></h2>

        <h2>
      As a project for Jewel and Lotus, I was asked to make a program to help automate the onboarding of new vendors who also have a presence on Etsy.  Etsy does come with tools to export a vendor's products as a CSV file for importing into other stores like Shopify, but sometimes life gets in the way, a vendor is too busy to export their products themselves, and my script lets us extract all the data we need from their product pages so we can import those products into the shopify store for them when it's more convenient that way. </h2>

        <h2>I use Discord, a free VOIP/chat server program, to stay in touch with my friends and meet new people.  Bots are a common thing in Discord servers and help automate server management tasks (preventing spam, greeting new members, extending a server's functionality) and can provide fun new features to play around with.  I made a bot using <a href="http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">discord.py</a>, which serves as a Python wrapper for the Discord API.  The PartyBot can play games with users and provides a couple of other tools, such as the ability to look up word definitions on various sites and send greetings in response to user input.  It's hosted on Heroku's free tier 24/7, and can be invited to a Discord server from <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=369851263480889345&scope=bot&permissions=0">this</a> link.</h2>
