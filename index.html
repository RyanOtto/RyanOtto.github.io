      <p>I play a lot of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, and these games involve a lot of dice rolling to determine whether or not something your character does is a success, a failure, or a critical hit/miss.  Since there's no single system of what dice to roll or what the numbers mean, it can be hard to find a good dice rolling program for your particular ruleset.  I also got tired of rolling my dice off of tables/desks/other flat surfaces and having to keep manual track of all the results. That's why I made a program that lets the user define their own rules/sets of dice, and tells you how many successes, failures and criticals that you get for you.</p>

      <p>I like killing time with incremental games and was interested in trying out Android app development, so I made one that you can find <a style="color:blue" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryan.PathToAnEmpire">here</a>, on the Android Play Store.</p>  It took around two months of development to make and is fully functional.

      <p>While speaking to a hiring manager, I was challenged to create a Python script that would parse through a list of documents, count the most frequently occurring words, and output the top five words with their accompanying sentences and the documents in which they appear.  It was interesting because I had to account for a number of special cases that occur in text files.  As one Stack Overflow contributer put it, "Not all sentences end with a period."  To get around these cases, I used the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk">NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).</a></p>
